Source code for the [API Platform + React.JS Course](https://github.com/piotr-jura-udemy/api-platform-react-js/tree/master) - developed by Piotr Jura, 2018

## This is a forked repo

I needed to fork this repo to create my own branches, or tags, while working through the video lectures.

I'm learning intermediate PHP, and Fullstack Web Development.

This React-JS repo is a part of the Udemy Course.
